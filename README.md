Welcome! This is a simple yet powerful **Streamlit app** that helps you generate accurate monthly billing reports. Just select a month, and the app will calculate charges for all active items during that time — handling overlaps, rate differences, and billing periods like a pro.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

* ✅ Figures out which items were **active during the selected month**
* ✅ Calculates charges **based on the number of active days**
* ✅ **Groups similar items** smartly (same item, same rate, same time window)
* ✅ Outputs a clean, easy-to-read **summary with total revenue**
* ✅ Built with **Streamlit**, so it’s interactive and easy to use

---

## 🖥️ Quick Demo

**Input:** A month like `"2024-11"`
**Output:**

```json
{
  "line_items": [
    {
      "item_code": "Executive Desk (4*2)",
      "rate": 1080.0,
      "qty": 25,
      "amount": 27000.0,
      "billing_period": "2024-11-01 to 2024-11-30"
    }
  ],
  "total_revenue": 72000.0
}
```

The app handles everything in the background — you just pick the month!

## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

Here’s how the billing logic works:

* Each item has a **start** and **stop** date.
* We check if it was active in the selected month.
* We calculate the **number of active days** and compute a **pro-rated amount**.
* If multiple entries match in `item_code`, `rate`, and active period, we **group them** into one line item.
* The total revenue is simply the sum of all individual amounts.

## 🧾 Example Item Format

Here’s what one item looks like in the data:

```json
{
  "item_code": "Executive Desk (4*2)",
  "qty": 10,
  "rate": "1000",
  "start_date": "2023-11-01",
  "stop_date": "2024-10-17"
}
```
